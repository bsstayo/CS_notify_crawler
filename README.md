# CS Notify Crawler
"Crawling notification of some university's CS department websites, and display it"

One day, I saw my school department website and realized:

> ‚ÄúWhy SKKU CS doesn‚Äôt provide infos what I really wanted?‚Äù

So, I decided to make a crawler which can automatically gathering announcements in [SKKU CS Notice page](https://cs.skku.edu/ko/news/notice/list) at my holiday(March 22-30, 2022). Here‚Äôs a thing. We can easily think about not only SKKU‚Äôs data, but Korean top universities CS webpages like [SNU](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/department-notices), [KAIST](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/bbs/notice), [GIST](https://eecs.gist.ac.kr/prog/bbsArticle/BBSMSTR_000000000294/list.do;jsessionid=B9E6571A886055D9CCE4AFDE0FED954D), [Yonsei](https://cs.yonsei.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub5_1), [Korea(Undergrad.)](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/board/notice_under.do), [Korea(Grad.)](https://cs.korea.ac.kr/cs/board/notice_grad.do) can also helpful. Besides for each schools have their own hiring/internship announcement boards, I can use these informations too!

### So, what‚Äôs the crawling?

I found some crawling examples, because most of examples are based on python, it looks super easy, so I think I don‚Äôt have to spend much time. But one blog has changed my mind.

[üñ® 'Ïõπ ÌÅ¨Î°§Îü¨' Ï¢Ä Í∑∏Îßå ÎßåÎì§Ïñ¥Îùº](https://velog.io/@mowinckel/%EC%9B%B9-%ED%81%AC%EB%A1%A4%EB%A7%81-I)

This blog has changed my idea

Crawling was not that easy idea, and there were lots of researches have being work through years!
So in that website, recommended some papers about crawling, so I decided read them first.

- **[DOM based content extraction via text density](http://www.ofey.me/papers/cetd-sigir11.pdf)**
- **[Web Crawler Architecture](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/EDS-WebCrawlerArchitecture.pdf)**
- [**Web Crawler: A Review**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258789938_Web_Crawler_A_Review)

Each of them will be summarized... maybe... when I get myself right...
